# Obi-Wifi-Stecker-Schuko-Version-2-Arduino
Working Code for the second version of the Obi Wifi Schuko. Use "Generic ESP8266 Module" in the Arduino IDE.

The code for debouncing the button follows in the next days.

It is without any support for mqtt and is for the users who only want control the Obi Wifi Schuko with http-commands.

Have Fun!
